### Long term immunity of human intereaction with malaria 
drive include: wildtype drive functional_resistance non_functional_resistance
human include: healthy (patent_infection sub_patent_infection) resistance_factor_of_population
modification drive that slow down malaria transmission
cage or 1-dimension
expected result: faster drive should be more efficient in eliminating malaria
