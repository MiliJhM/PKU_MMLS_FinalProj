# PKU_MMLS_FinalProj
 The final assignment for the Biomathematics Modeling course at Peking University.

## Abstract:

Implement a Markov linear model based human mosquito interaction model that can roughly predict the impact of gene driven technology on malaria transmission.

## TODO:

1. Human-mosquito-malaria transmission model based on SEIR.
2. Simulation model for the effect of gene driven factors on mosquito population size.
3. Spatial?
