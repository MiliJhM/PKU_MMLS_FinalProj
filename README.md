# PKU_MMLS_FinalProj
 The final assignment for the Biomathematics Modeling course at Peking University.

## To Start With

The model is constructed in `spacial.m`, with the parameters being the passed in hyperparameter structure. 

We provide several entrances to quickly complete grid search/Minimum mean square error fitting:

* `main.m` provides a convenient and efficient script for grid searching of model hyperparameters.
* `main1.m` is provided to implement Minimum mean square error fitting for some parameters of the model.
* `init.m` is used for fast one-dimensional traversal of hyperparameters.
