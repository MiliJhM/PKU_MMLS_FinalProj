# Project idea (V0.0)

#### Project Members: 孙伟棠 刘奕宇 马佳昊 曹靖宵

##### Topic

Human-mosquito-malaria transmission model based on SEIR.

Simulation model for the effect of gene driven factors on mosquito population size or malaria transmission rate.

##### The reason why we picked the topic

Gene drive technology can be used to control the population size and distribution of pests and pathogenic organisms, thereby reducing their impact on human health.

##### Models that may be good for this

Markov model, continuous/discrete spatial models.

##### Desigh of the model
1. Human-mosquito malaria model(without mosquito population changing)
Different state of mosquito(including sensitive incubation infectious) and human(healthy incubation patient),by frequency
Transmission rate in mosquito (sensitive->incubation) base on human patient rate. 
Transmission rate (healthy->incubation) base on resistant rate and mosuquito population size (fixed now) ,infectious mosquito rate ,resistance factor for human
A resistance factor to represent resistance level of people.Losing by time and increase when malaria transmission take place.

2. Human-mosquito malaria model(with mosquito population changing).
Find/compare different density-dependent curve
Mosquito life cycle modeling , focusing on gene frequency(incuding drive) and population size

#### Working Plan
1. Make a Human-mosquito malaria model without 
2. Add gene drive and mosquito life cycle to the model
3. Use diffusion coefficient to add spatial feature 

#### Question want to answer
1. How does life curve influence suppression drive?
2. The minimum vector density
3. The best way to eliminate malaria(modification/suppression)

#### Need to discuss
1. Which kind of drive (modification/suppression)
2. Select important necessary and realizable ideas, remove the rest ones
