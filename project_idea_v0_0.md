# Project idea (V0.0)

#### Project Members: 孙伟棠 刘奕宇 马佳昊 曹靖宵

##### Topic

Human-mosquito-malaria transmission model based on SEIR.

Simulation model for the effect of gene driven factors on mosquito population size.

##### The reason why we picked the topic

Gene drive technology can be used to control the population size and distribution of pests and pathogenic organisms, thereby reducing their impact on human health.

##### Models that may be good for this

Markov model, continuous/discrete spatial models.
